# Tor-Scraping 
Tor works by sending your traffic through three random servers (also known as relays) in the Tor network. The last relay in the circuit (the “exit relay”) then sends the traffic out onto the public Internet. The image above illustrates a user browsing to different websites over Tor.
In this script we are using tor as browser to crawl websites without getting blocked.
